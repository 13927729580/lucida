# Automatic Speech Recognition
The current implementation of ASR uses [Kaldi](http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/),
a speech recognition toolkit written in C++ that is freely available under the Apache license. 

To build and start the Kaldi ASR service, please navigate to `kaldi_asr` and follow the `README.md` there.

## Note:

If you want to use another ASR implementation,
you can start by creating a separate folder parallel to `kaldi_asr`.
