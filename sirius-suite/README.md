Each kernel contains:

- input (when applicable, larger inputs not included)
- baseline
- pthread
- GPU (when applicable)
- bits: this folder contains trial or old versions

Each version has its own `Makefile` inside the directory.

Each benchmark is run the following way:
```bash
$ ./executable ../input/input
```

Some kernels have their own dedicated READMEs.
